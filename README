So this is a readme file. Or something like that.

Everything works.
********************************
And that's amazing. As it is, it doesn't produce a single compile error or warning. 

Every component has been tested to ensure nothing produces unexpected bugs. All 
that's needed now is for you to fill out the remaining functions, and it's ready.

I know it's not pretty, but the makefile works too. :D


Structure
********************************
There are 4 files in total:

hw2.h is the universal header file
hw2.c contains MAIN and holds everything together
ListOps.c contains functions used for manipulating the list
ItemOps.c contains functions used for manipulating items within the list
Output.c contains the output printer. 

A full listing of functions contained within each file can be found in hw2.h



Functions
********************************
The majority of functions return 'void' and take only one parameter -- 'List *list'.

This is OK because 'List', which is the linked list co-ordinator, contains all necessary
information for the manipulation of lists, including the current selected list, the 
locations of the first and last list item, as well as a pointer to the current item. 

The only exceptions are some of the Edit* functions -- they have an extra parameter to
toggle the output printer, so they do not refresh output when creating a new item. 

Why the unsigned chars? 8 bits for a char versus 32 bits for an int. You use less RAM. 

Two functions have been included in hw2.c -- GetUserInput and PrintHelp. These functions
neither manipulate the list or items, and are best left there. 



Incomplete Functions
********************************
Descriptions have been given where possible in the function itself.



Variable Naming Convention
********************************
Follows standard Style Guide conventions. 
Initial character is always lower-case, all other 'words' in a name are capitalised for clarity.

Example: x, y, pages, printCounter



Function Naming Convention
********************************
Follows Powershell 'cmdlet' convention.
First letter of each word is capitalised.
First word is a verb. Second word is a noun. The noun has the verb done to it. 

Example: CheckDate, PrintList, RemoveTask
